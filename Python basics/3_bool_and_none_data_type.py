# Studying bool data types and None
# Boolean data types are created to indicate the truth or falsity of a particular piece of code
# Boolean values are always capitalized in code

# create a variable with a boolean value True and False
a = True
print (a)
# resualt: True
b = False
print (type(b))
# resualt: False

# comparison of two data types
print (a == b)
# resualt: True

# truth check of two examples with a comparison
print (2>1==a)
# resualt: True
print (2<1==a)
# resualt: False

#creating a boolean value, without using True and False
x = 2==2
print (x)
# resualt: True
print (type(x))
# resualt: bool

# value None, which means that the variable is empty
a = None
print (a)
# resualt:

# pseudocode where you can see an example of applying None
### connection = database.connect ###
### not_connetc = connection is None ###
